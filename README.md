# 01-HTML-CSS-Git-refactor-solution

## Description

This repository contains all files associated with the HTML CSS Git refactored code challenge from week 1 of the Front End Developer Coding bootcamp. The project aimed to make the Horiseon website more accessible to disabled people using assistive technologies, on behalf of a marketing agency. This project enabled me to apply semantic elements to a real world problem and think carefully about the impact that different tags have on users' experiences of a website. This project also gave me more exposure to using Github as a platform for version control.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website has been refactored to take into account accessibility needs. The website can be used by anyone, but the semantic elements make it easier for assistive technologies to access.

Please see below for a screenshot of the refactored website, with a link below it.
